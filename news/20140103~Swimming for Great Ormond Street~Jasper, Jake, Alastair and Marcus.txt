On Friday 3rd January 2014 the G.O.S.H. It’s Cold! Swimming the Channel Relay Team went to Great Ormond Street Hospital to present the cheque for the money that we had raised for the hospital by doing a relay channel swim on 26th July 2013 in 11 hours 54 minutes and 30 seconds.

The team consisted of three Dr Challoner’s past and present pupils. Jake Bulgin (Yr 12), Jasper Copp (Yr 12), Alastair Dawson (alumni) and Marcus Johansson. We were all members of Chesham Swimming Club. We had been organising and preparing for this swim for 2 years and so it was a great honour for us to be able to go to the hospital and present our cheque for £10,657.04 to Professor Martin Elliott, Co-Medical Director of Great Ormond Street Hospital and a pioneering heart surgeon.  Our team spirit for the channel swim was brilliant and the experience was something that we will never forget. We would like to thank everyone who helped us and who kindly donated so that we were able to raise over our target of £10,000 to help children with great medical need at the hospital.
