Once again we start a new year and it's time for the new Year 12 prefects to begin their first duties.

For this new batch, the term began with a training day: a tour of the school showed us the secrets and tricks of the trade for all places around the site, and other sessions with Mr Atkinson, the School Captain Nick Brabbs and his deputies (in which we discussed how to be a 'perfect prefect', a phrase Nick announces he's coined himself) and Mr Duggan and Mrs Black, who spoke about dealing with trouble in the school.

The new Year 12 mentors will also soon start their work with the Year 7s after meeting and discussing the job with Mr Graham, the Head of Year 7.

Good luck to all new prefects and mentors for the next year.
