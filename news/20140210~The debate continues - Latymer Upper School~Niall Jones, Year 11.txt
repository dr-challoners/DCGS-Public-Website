On the 10th February, four Challoner’s students from Years 11 to 13 navigated the tube network to Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith for the first round of the Oxford Schools’ Debate. The teams were Niall Jones and Elliott Christensen as DCGS A and Elliot Ford and Jack Hogan as DCGS B. Both teams excelled in difficult rooms, taking on advice from the judge and debating coach Jack to do better in the second debate.

The two motions were very different, allowing the teams to practice both social and political debates: the first motion being ‘This House would require all schools to hand out condoms to students’, and the second being ‘This House would remove fixed terms for all democratically elected leaders’. Both teams managed to successfully battle with the issues at stake and, although sadly neither team progressed to the next round, it was a very good experience for both teams who have improved greatly and look forward to more competitions in the future.
