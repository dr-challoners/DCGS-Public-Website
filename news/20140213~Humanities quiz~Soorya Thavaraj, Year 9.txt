As part of Humanities Week, Years 7 to 10 participated in a humanities quiz. The topics were Business Studies, Geography, History, Politics, RS and Economics. These were questions that the pupils weren’t taught in class but knew out of their own knowledge. 'It’s designed to stretch the pupils,' said Mrs Cornelius.

To give you an idea of the difficulty of the questions, in the Geography set of questions was the question 'Where is the world’s highest capital city?' In Economics you had to match up the currency to the country and name the world's largest bank.

Happening in the Milton Library, the teams of six tried their hardest as it counted as a house competition. In Year 7 and 8 Holman were victorious, Thorne came a close second and Rayner did well in third. In fourth was Newman, in fifth was Foxell and in sixth place came Rayner who tried hard. In Year 9 and 10, only two points separated first and second. In first place was Newman with Holman coming just missing out. Pearson came third and Thorne were fourth. Foxell came fifth and Rayner, who were sixth, brought the competition to a close. Humanities week has come to an exciting end with this challenging competition.
