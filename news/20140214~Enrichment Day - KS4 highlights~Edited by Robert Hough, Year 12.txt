For the Year 11s this enrichment day, being the last of its kind before the GCSE exams, was one which many of the students looked to in order to provide a much needed break from coursework, homework and controlled assessments!

Led by the ever-present Mrs Baker and staged at Wycombe Wanderers stadium, the boys had to develop, in groups of 8 or 9, ideas to help the Wycombe Wanderers Sports and Education Trust increase their awareness amongst the local community. Motivated by a special goody box prepared by Mrs Baker, the task was to prepare a presentation, without the use of PowerPoint or anything of its kind, to present to a panel of judges consisting of teaching staff and local business people.

All of the presentations were thoroughly enjoyed and they really showcased the enthusiasm of the teams, but the winning team swayed the students and judges largely thanks to a fantastic solo rendition of _True Colours_ by Tom Gogarty - a memorable experience in itself - as well as some interesting ideas that the Wycombe Wanderers staff were keen to take note of.

Special mentions must also go to Nick Prokopiou and Jake North for their innovation throughout the project. Overall, the day was enjoyed by teachers and students alike, and was a great way to cap off the half term.
