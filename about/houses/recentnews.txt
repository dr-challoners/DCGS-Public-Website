Things are very tight at the top of the House Competition at the moment with Foxell’s lead having been whittled away by some strong performances from Rayner in Team Maths and Challoner’s Speaks competitions. The winners of the increasingly popular Challoner’s Speaks were Finlay Burrell (10P), Finlay Carroll (9N), Jenson Thomas (8T) and Rishi Shah (7H).  The keenly-contested House University Challenge is currently pulling in the crowds and leading to some nail-biting finishes. Basketball and Humanities competitions are also coming up as is the first ever House Music Video!

In the last few weeks we have had the extremely popular events of House Football and House Drama. Foxell's excellent start to this year's competition saw them win Y9A, Y9B and Y8B events whilst Pearson claimed the honours in both Y10 and Y11. House Drama this year took on a slightly different form with each House being allocated their own Revolting Rhyme to perform. The standard was once again excellent and in a very close final Holman's performance of Snow White judged to be the winner ahead of a memorable Foxell adaptation of Little 'Rouge' Riding Hood.

House Darts and Climbing are coming up this term as well as the results from the Grand Draw.
